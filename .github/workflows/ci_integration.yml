# We only run the integration tests with Bors. There is a specific reason for
# this. Using Bors makes it easier for us to limit the total number of
# concurrent jobs. This is important because it keeps us from triggering
# GitHub's abuse rate limits.

  merge_group: # GitHub Merge Queue
  pull_request: # but we will skip the integration tests on PR builds, to avoid hitting rate limits
  workflow_dispatch: # can manually trigger integration tests for PRs
